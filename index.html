        <ul>
        <li>Priority Based Inventory Management:</li>
            
        <dd> - Created a priority-based inventory management that is number-based to organize supply ordering based on priority number of the supply. For example, cups and sandwich boxes would be in priority category 1.</dd>
            
        <dd> - Java 8 was for programming the main functions of the program such order, cancel, or hold. Java was also needed to operate the functions of SceneBuilder to build the GUI to emphasize user interaction with the program.</dd> 
            
        <dd> - MySQL was for scripting the database tables and testing functions such as merging supply items based on their priority numbers. For example, number one is for drinking cups while number 6 will be for sandwich boxes.</dd> 
            
        <li>Banking Project:</li>
            
        <dd> - Designed a banking project to program basic banking functions such as withdrawal, deposit, or transfer. In addition, there is a customer and an employee in which both have credentials with a username and password.</dd> 
            
        <dd> - Java was used for programming the functions of the bank while connecting to a PostgreSQL database. Logging is also used to document new users and new accounts.</dd>
            
        <dd> - The PostgreSQL database connects through the Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud and through the database queries are tested to be called into the Java program to connect the database.</dd>
            
        <dd> - Through the database tables with client information is  stored including newer clients that are logged.</dd>

        <dd> - Composed a console navigator that receives user input on the direction of the room they are heading in through the console using Java.</dd> 
            
        <dd> - The example is the user enters “north” and the user is in the living room, but when the user enters “south,” the user approaches the basement.</dd> 
            
        <dd> - The project was based on the console game named “Zork.”</dd>
